# Personal Portfolio

## Welcome to my personal portfolio project!

Hello! Welcome to my Readme regarding the structure, and thought process of my personal portfolio website! This website was one of many projects The Odin Project tasked it's students with to not only get a better understanding of making a personal portfolio but also giving us the ability to utilize all of the skills we've learned so far and bring it all together in one package!
In this project I got to use a lot of my skills I have picked up from learning React and advanced HTML/CSS and JavaScript practices! Although this project may never truly be finished as I intend to upkeep it with more projects and tweaking the design, i'm very happy with how it has taken shape! Some of the key features I learned in this project was how to utilize components, props, and managing state between components! Something in the future I intend on doing is going back and utilizing React Router to make the entire code base easier to manage, read, and update! Thank you so much for taking the time to look through my project and read my README!
